								<div class="div4" style="text-align: left;">
									<ul><li><b>Electricity Price Prediction:</b> This model for electric vehicles (EVs) is a specialized forecasting system that estimates the future electricity prices specifically tailored for EV charging. This model takes into account factors such as time of day, location, demand patterns, and market dynamics to provide accurate predictions of electricity prices for EV charging stations. By utilizing this model, EV owners and operators can optimize their charging strategies, take advantage of lower electricity rates during off-peak hours, and make cost-effective decisions regarding EV charging, ultimately promoting efficient and affordable EV adoption. </li><br>
									<li><b>Diabetes Prediction:</b>This model is a data-driven tool designed to forecast the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes in the future. By analyzing various risk factors such as age, weight, family history, lifestyle choices, and medical history, the model can assess an individual's susceptibility to diabetes. This predictive model utilizes advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret large datasets, providing valuable insights that can help healthcare professionals identify high-risk individuals and implement preventive measures. The goal of a diabetes prediction model is to enable early intervention and personalized care, ultimately reducing the burden of diabetes and improving overall health outcomes. </li><br>
									<li><b>Image Detection:</b>This model is specifically designed to distinguish between images of pizza and steak. Using deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model analyzes the visual features and patterns present in the images to make accurate predictions. By training on a dataset of labeled images of pizza and steak, the model learns to differentiate between the two classes based on their unique characteristics such as shape, texture, color, and visual cues specific to each food item. Once trained, the model can classify new images as either pizza or steak, providing an automated and reliable solution for food classification tasks.</li><br>
									<li><b>Apparel Recognition System:</b>This system is an advanced technology that utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify and classify various types of clothing and apparel items. By analyzing visual features such as patterns, colors, shapes, and textures, the system can accurately recognize and categorize different apparel items, including shirts, dresses, pants, shoes, and accessories. This system finds applications in various domains, such as fashion e-commerce, inventory management, virtual try-on, and personalized styling recommendations. By automating the apparel recognition process, it enhances efficiency, improves user experiences, and enables businesses to streamline their operations in the fashion industry.</li><br>
									<li><b>Depth Estimation:</b>Depth estimation using the MiDaS (Multiple Image Dense Depth Estimation) computer vision model utilizes deep learning algorithms to estimate the depth information from a single input image. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the MiDaS model analyzes the visual features and patterns within the image to infer the depth values at each pixel. This approach allows for the creation of a depth map, which represents the relative distance of objects from the camera's viewpoint. The MiDaS model has proven to be effective in various applications, including augmented reality, autonomous navigation, and 3D reconstruction. By providing accurate depth estimation, the MiDaS model enables enhanced understanding of the scene geometry and facilitates the development of advanced computer vision systems.</li><br>
